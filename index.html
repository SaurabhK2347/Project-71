When we do earn it, we all get so excited that we are going to the Auditorium. We get Ice Cream as we watch some people perform. We also watch somethings like movies or shows on the screen that drops down in to the Auditorium. It is a very fun place to be because there is no classwork or homework in the Auditorium, just fun!! </p>

<p> The Debate lasted for one hour. It was so intense and it felt like we had a tough competition. Which we did. The other team's people had many reasons and evidence to support and backup their side. We also did the same things and we all took turns to go. The opposing team went first and then our team went. This kept on happening back and forth until everyone was done. The principal clapped for everyone and said that she was so proud! A few days later, we got the results for the winning team and it said that we had beat them by 18 points! We were so happy and felt so relieved that everyone was cheering and the teachers threw us a party! The other team did an awesome job too!</p>

<p>The Soccer Match lasted forever and everyone was so tired. I was on the defending part of my team where I had to steal the ball and either try to make a goal or pass it to one of my team mates. I scored 1 or 2 goals in the first half. But the +refree blew the whistle and said it was halftime. We all went to go get water and we came up with a plan to win the match. The score was 4-5 and our score was 4. We were losing by one goal. The other team scored another goal and we were now 2 scores behind. One of my friends on my team went to make a goal and he did, but. He hit his leg on the hard ground and got injured. The refree said that he could not play and now we were one player short. The other team was about to score when I took the ball and passed it to my team mate and then he scored. We had to get one more goal in to win. We all knew we had to give everything we have in order to make this goal. One of my friends took the ball and hurried towards the other team's goal, but they stopped him and took the ball from him. He stole it back and kicked. AND HE SCORED!! Everone on our team was so happy that we had beat the other team! I have to give a Hats off to the other team because they were tough to beat. We all got Ice Cream after and enjoyed victory!</p>

<p>Everyone had to bring a Science Project to school for our big day, The Science Project Competition. Everyone was so excited and everyone had some really great projects. I made a Charcoal water filter. The teachers and everyone's parents were walking around and looking at everyone's projects. When everyone was done looking at the kid's projects, the teachers and parents decided that they really liked everyone's projects. But they all agreed that Arbor Creek Elementary's students' projects were better than the other school's kids' projects. So we had just won the Science Project Competition and we were champions. To clebrate the victory, our principal told our school that we can go on a field trip to the Beach! Everyone got so excited and nobody could until that day came!  </p>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens mudt be better organised and effecient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen will be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Oredering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling. Making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

<h4>Implemented Online Attendence Management System</h4>
<img src="Online-Attendance-System-for-Students_banner.png" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
Humans are prone to errors, even if we provide them with supporting computional devices. Automated attendence management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.

2. Economics
Have you ever thought that attendence management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteelsm, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axisum Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendence management systems.

3. Productivity/
Effecienty Monitoring and managing attendence manually can be time consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious time administration time with automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
